# Live Commentary in React using Server-Sent Events (SSE)

This project demonstrates how to implement live commentary in a React app using Server-Sent Events (SSE) and the `EventSource` API to create a persistent connection to a server.

## Features
- **React Frontend**: Displays live commentary in real-time.
- **Server-Sent Events**: Utilizes the `EventSource` API to receive server updates.
- **Stubbed Data**: Uses an array of strings as commentary data, with the ability to extend to real-time third-party API data.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
2. to start server npm run start
3. to start client npm run dev

### Future Scope
Replace stubbed data with real-time third-party API.
Improve UI/UX with enhanced formatting and error handling.
